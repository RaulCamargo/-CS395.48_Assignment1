            <h2>Annoying and amusing traits:</h2>
            <h3>The Dog</h3>
            <p>
                The dog does not like to be alone so I have to leave my bedroom door open when he stays at my place so he can come in.<br/>
                I work nights so this usually ends up waking me up sooner than I would like.<br/>
                If you offer him a treat but don't give it to him right away he'll go through all his tricks until you do.<br/>
            </p>
            <h3>The Cat</h3>
            <p>
                The cat likes to make me look bad in front of my girlfriend.<br/>
                Whenever she is around he makes sure to run away from me as if I had done something to him.<br/>
                When she comes home he yells at her until she gives him some of the tube treats.<br/>
